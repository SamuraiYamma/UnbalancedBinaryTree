# UnbalancedBinaryTree
This was a homework assigned by Dr. Dulimarta.
It utilizes unique_ptr to create an unbalanced binary tree.

He was the author of the testing code. If any changes were/are made, they will be clearly marked so that the reader can tell what is original work and what is not. 

The BinaryTree.hpp file is the student's work.

Make sure you include the CMake file, as it builds the project correctly.
